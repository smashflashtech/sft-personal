# SmashFlashTech - A Portfolio

This is my first ever portfolio website. Here you can get to know me a little better, see my work, and find ways to get in touch. 

### Motivation
First and foremost, I would love a job. Hire me! I recently completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive in December of 2020. As rigorous as any bootcamp always is, there always is still more to learn and more to be done. I wanted to create a website to establish my digital presence, showcase my projects, continue to practice and learn new skills that I may not have gotten to try up to date. I took this website as an opportunity to play around in the sandbox and continue to accquire new skills.
