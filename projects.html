          <p class="pSpace2"><span class=" yellow f2 emphasis unica">Problem:</span><br /> Lack of integration of
            techonology in behavior analytic reseaerch is a missed opportunity. What better way to measure human
            behavior than with highly tuned software? Technology can increase the accuracy of data collection and
            immediacy of feedback.</p>
          <p class="pSpace2"><span class=" yellow f2 emphasis unica">Solution:</span><br /> This application
            automatically displays stimuli, collect data, calculates performance, and determines how the participant
            proceeds through the experiement based on their performance. This increases the immediacy of feedback and efficiency of in the moment participant flow. It decreases the likelihood of passing participants erroneously due to human error when calculating performance under time pressure thereby strengthening protocol fidelity. Upon each user click, the application sends information to the back-end where it is stored in a database. The researcher can retrieve information from the database when she (or he) wants to analyze data for individual participants or across participants, groups, phases, etc.</p>
          <p class="pSpace2"><span class=" yellow f2 emphasis unica">Reflection:</span><br /> I designed this
            application for my doctoral dissertation research in Behavior Analysis.
            With the pandemic in full swing, I needed to design a protocol that could be delivered over the internet, otherwise my research would be suspended until we are cleared to interact freely with other humans again. I needed an application that could present stimuli, a dependent variable that could be measured though user interaction with the browser, and an application that could immediately grab user input data and store it for me. Bear with me here üôè&nbsp&nbsp, this is a passion project, so I have a lot to say:</p>
            <p class="pSpace2">I discovered how quickly I can learn a new language, apply it, and continue to learn independently. After only three days of formal instruction covering Python, I built out this application. I also learned so much
            during this project because it had so many moving parts and provided me with extensively varied sample of experiences put into practice.</p>
            <p class="pSpace2">For instance, the application required a body of data to serve the stimuli to the front-end. I chose to supply the front-end with data from JSON files that would normally come from an API (that would have been a whole other project on its own) because, given the time constraints, it wouldn‚Äôt have been practical use of my my time. Using JSON files was a quick alternative. Even though I didn‚Äôt create an API, doing this taught me a lot about how I should structure and organize an API because I didn‚Äôt create perfect JSON files right off the bat (<span class="italicGray">darn</span>). I started off organizing data like a researcher would, I grouped all information related to a phase together in one large file. As a result, sometimes when I pulled information for a certain task, a lot of extraneous information came along for the ride‚ÄîI could tell this was inefficient. Several times, I went back and change the structure of the JSON files to make it more practical. I ended up with several JSON files organized completely differently. This exercise of creating JSONs and trying retrieve data from them opened my eyes to the importance of planning databases and <span class="italic">testing</span> getting information from them. Without putting it into practice, sometimes its hard to imagine what that looks like. That was only data retrieval, writing user input data to a database was another lesson in and of itself.  </p>
            <p class="pSpace2"> This project supplied me with a me with a huge body of data to organize and from it I began to recognize patterns. Looking at redudancies in the data I collected, I began to understand
            how new tables could be created to hold redundant information and how tables are more efficient as the data becomes numbers that relate the information. Essentially this was the inception of my understanding how one can normalize a database to increase efficiency. </p>
            <p class="pSpace2">The current state of application is only one portion of what will be required for my dissertation. It will continue to grow as I develop the research protocol. Keep checking in to see how this
            project changes!</p>

        <p class="pSpace"><span class=" yellow f2 emphasis unica">Solution:</span><br /> A website to exercise my
          endeavors and showcase by ongoing growth. A playground to noodle around with the gimmicks and icing that make
          a website fun, interactive, and just look plain nice (hopefully).

        <p class="pSpace"><span class=" yellow f2 emphasis unica">Reflection:</span><br /> I had a running wishlist of
          things wanted to learn to do but hadn‚Äôt gotten to try during my stint at GA. I went down that list, researched
          each skill, and ticked them off one by one. Here are those bullet points:</p>
        <div class="wishlist">
          <ul class="wl single-before">
            <li>  Video Tags</li>
            <li>  CSS Grayscale</li>
            <li>  Slider Input</li>
            <li>  Dark Mode</li>
            <li>  Hamburger Menu</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="wl single-before">
            <li>  Accordian Menus</li>
            <li>  What are Ems?</li>
            <li>  CSS Shapes</li>
            <li>  Diamond Photos</li>
            <li>  Diamond Grid Menus</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="wl single-before">
            <li>  Transform Attribute</li>
            <li>  Footers</li>
            <li>  Media Queries</li>
            <li>  Modals</li>
            <li>  Position & Z-Indexes</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="pSpace">Design was really something I hadn‚Äôt thought enough about. Naively, I thought: ‚ÄúHey, I took AP art in high school (<span class="italicGray">...17
        years ago...</span>), I‚Äôll probably be good at this.‚Äù But physical art is so different, in principle, from art that is
        created purely by light. Some of the things you normally would do in art will straight-up blind your viewer on
        the web. Not only that, design isn‚Äôt just about balance and movement‚Äîbut also ergonomic functionality. Every
        free chance I got, I browsed excellent web design, read a UX/UI article, or watched tutorial. My friends would say my everyday style is retro to begin with--
        so I‚Äôm still working my way toward modern design. This is just the
        start of my mission to think critically about design meets functionality.
